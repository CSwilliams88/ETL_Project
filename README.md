# NBA Injuries
![kobe.png](Images/kobe.png)

For this project my team and I wanted to look at how injuries impact different team in the National Basketball Association. First step was to find a good source for this data, we landed on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/). We were able to find a CSV file that outlined every injury in the NBA from the year 2010-2020, that proved to be exactly what we needed. 
Another key component would be the data for each NBA team over the course of each season. To obtain this data once again we searched [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) and was able find another CSV file that was very detailed with a variety of different statistics. As a result, we can determine the impact of injuries in regards to different things such as wins/losses, points, shooting percentages, etc.
